Welcome to the Augmented Reality Chemistry Lab, an innovative application that transforms chemistry education through immersive augmented reality (AR). This app allows users to explore chemical reactions, visualize molecular structures, and conduct virtual experiments via AR, offering an engaging and interactive learning experience. Designed for both iOS and Android devices, it combines education with cutting-edge technology.

The AR Chemistry Lab features an immersive AR experience where users can interact with 3D molecular structures and perform experiments in a virtual lab setting. The user interface is intuitive, making it easy to navigate and utilize various features. The app supports cross-platform functionality, ensuring a consistent experience across both iOS and Android devices. Users can manipulate molecular structures, scale objects, and configure their virtual lab with simple touch controls. The application also includes a sophisticated experiment simulation system to visualize hybrid orbitals and chemical reactions in real-time.

Technical details include Unity version 2021.2.16f1 and AR Foundation for a unified AR experience. The app utilizes assets from Sketchfab, Unity Asset Store, and custom-built models using Blender.

To get started, download the APK file and Unity project from the provided Box link. Follow the on-screen instructions for installation and use. A detailed user guide is available to help with navigation, lab configuration, and experiment conduction.

Future enhancements will focus on adding more experiments, improving device compatibility, and introducing collaborative features. The development of this project has highlighted the importance of iterative testing, user feedback, and adaptation to evolving technologies.

The AR Chemistry Lab successfully meets its goal of making chemistry education interactive and enjoyable, and there are plans to expand and improve the application to enhance the learning experience further.
